## Time Management Tips

**If students struggle with time:**

1. **Use starter templates** - Provide basic HTML structure
2. **Provide CSS frameworks** - Or CSS starter file with variables
3. **Pair programming** - Allow partnerships
4. **Stagger deadlines** - Milestones for sections
5. **Focus on core** - Emphasize required sections, make others optional

## Answer: Is It Too Much?

**For a single assignment: YES, if done in full.**

**Recommended approach:**
- **Core**: Header + Hero + Sections 1-3 + One JS feature = Manageable
- **Extensions**: Additional sections and features for extra credit
- **Time**: 2-3 week assignment window
- **Grading**: Flexible rubric allowing different depths

This way, all students can complete the core, while advanced students can push further with extensions.
