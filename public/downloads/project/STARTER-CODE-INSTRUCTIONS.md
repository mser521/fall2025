# Starter Code Instructions for Students

## What You've Been Given

You have starter code that provides:
- ✅ HTML structure with section placeholders
- ✅ CSS variables for colors and spacing
- ✅ Basic reset styles
- ✅ Container class for layout

## What You Need to Write

You must write ALL of the following:

### HTML
- [ ] Complete header navigation with logo and links
- [ ] Hero section content (heading, text)
- [ ] Section 1: Two-column layout with content
- [ ] Section 2: 4 service cards with images and text
- [ ] Section 3: 4 action cards with icons and text
- [ ] All image tags with proper alt attributes
- [ ] All links and buttons

### CSS
- [ ] Header styles (position, flexbox layout)
- [ ] Hero section styles (full viewport, background image)
- [ ] Grid layouts for cards (CSS Grid)
- [ ] Card component styles
- [ ] Button styles (primary and tertiary)
- [ ] Hover effects on cards and buttons
- [ ] Typography styles for headings
- [ ] Section-specific styling

### JavaScript
- [ ] Choose ONE feature:
  - Carousel navigation (next/previous buttons)
  - OR Scroll-triggered animations
- [ ] Event listeners for interactivity
- [ ] DOM manipulation

## How to Use the Starter Code

1. **Uncomment the CSS link** in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <!-- Change this: -->
   <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> -->
   
   <!-- To this: -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

2. **Look for TODO comments** in both HTML and CSS:
   ```html
   <!-- TODO: Add your header navigation here -->
   ```

3. **Use CSS variables** instead of hardcoding colors:
   ```css
   /* Good: */
   background: var(--persian-coral);
   
   /* Avoid: */
   background: #ff9d79;
   ```

4. **Follow the structure** but write your own CSS:
   - The starter gives you organization
   - You write all the component styles

## Getting Help

- Check the task files (TASK-01-HEADER.md, etc.) for guidance
- Look at CSS Grid and Flexbox documentation
- Use browser DevTools to inspect elements
- Ask questions during office hours

## Remember

The starter code is meant to:
- ✅ Save you time on setup
- ✅ Show you the structure
- ✅ Provide design tokens (colors, spacing)

The starter code does NOT:
- ❌ Give you the answers
- ❌ Write CSS for you
- ❌ Replace learning the concepts

You'll learn by building these components yourself!
