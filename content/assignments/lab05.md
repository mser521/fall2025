## Introduction 
The goal of today's lab is to:
1. Help you practice using JavaScript to target and modify HTML elements in your DOM Tree.
1. Continue practicing your CSS skills.
1. Exploring some common UX/UI widgets and how they're implemented using JavaScript.

## Cheatsheet
Please see the [JavaScript Cheatsheet](/fall2025/resources/js-dom-cheatsheet) to get some hints and tips.


## Setup

<a href="/fall2025/downloads/lab05.zip" class="nu-button">Download Lab 5 <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a> 

Please download the lab05.zip file, unzip it, and move the tutorials folder inside of your `csci344/tutorials` folder. Then complete the tasks:

1. [Theme Switcher](#1-theme-switcher)
1. [Hamburger Menu](#2-hamburger-menu)
1. [Drawer](#3-drawer)
1. [Drawer Fancy](#4-fancy-drawer-bonus)
1. [Carousel](#5-carousel)

## 1. Theme Switcher
Open `styles.css` and scroll down to ~line 70. You will see three classes ( `ocean`, `desert`, and `high-contrast`) which correspond to three different themes. If you apply any of these classes to the `<body></body>` tag and preview your HTML, you will see that the theme changes. Try it out! 

You job is to make the buttons dynamically change the theme of the web page as pictured below. When you're done, your web page should look like this:

<img class="screenshot-xl" src="/fall2025/images/labs/lab05/theme-switcher.gif" />

### Hints:
1. Inside of `index.js`, create a single function called `changeClass()` that has one parameter, which will store the name of the class as a string.
2. Within the `changeClass()` function body, set the body's class attribute to the name of the class passed into the function. If the `default` button is clicked, just unset the class on the body tag.
3. Attach your `changeClass()` function to the click event of each button. Make sure you're passing in the correct argument. 
4. Use the [cheatsheet](/fall2025/resources/js-dom-cheatsheet) to figure out how to modify the class attribute.


### Optional
If you have time, try creating your own theme in the `styles.css` file and creating another button so that when you click on the new button, your theme shows up.


## 2. Hamburger Menu
As you probably already know, a hamburger menu is a common design pattern for showing and hiding the navigation of your web page if you are on a mobile device. 

<img class="screenshot-xs border" src="/fall2025/images/labs/lab05/hamburger.gif" />


Your job is to modify the JavaScript file so that it achieves the effect shown below. Specifically:
* Clicking the hamburger menu when **closed** adds the `active` class to both the `button` and `ul` elements.
* Clicking the hamburger menu when **open** removes the `active` class from both the `button` and `ul` elements.

**Hint**: Consider using the `classList.toggle("some_class")` method (see cheatsheet above, or google it). The `classList.toggle()` method will automatically add the class if it's not present, or remove it if it is present - perfect for this use case!


## 3. Drawer
Create a sliding drawer that opens from the left side of the screen by implementing the JavaScript functionality for the drawer.

<img class="screenshot-xl border" src="/fall2025/images/labs/lab05/drawer.gif" />

### Requirements for `drawer.js`
1. **Select the drawer element** using `document.querySelector("#drawer")`
2. **Create an `openDrawer()` function** that:
   - Adds the "open" class to the drawer element
   - Sets the `aria-hidden` attribute to "false"
3. **Create a `closeDrawer()` function** that:
   - Removes the "open" class from the drawer element
   - Sets the `aria-hidden` attribute to "true"

**Hints:**
- Use `element.classList.add()` and `element.classList.remove()` for CSS classes
- Use `element.setAttribute()` for ARIA attributes

### Requirements for `index.html`
1. Attach the `openDrawer()` function to the "Open" button's click event
2. Attach the `closeDrawer()` function to the "Close" button's click event

## 4. Fancy Drawer (Bonus)
For an extra challenge, try implementing the fancy drawer in the `04-drawer-fancy` folder. This drawer displays a gallery of images and shows the clicked image in a larger view.

<img class="screenshot-xl border" src="/fall2025/images/labs/lab05/drawer-fancy.gif" />


To do this you will modify the template in the JavaScript `openDrawer()` function to use some data from the DOM.

**Hints:**
- Use template literals (backticks) to create multi-line HTML strings
- Use `${variable}` syntax to insert variables into the template
- Use `element.innerHTML` to set the drawer's content



## 5. Carousel
If you were on a front-end team and in need of a carousel, you would probably use a pre-made widget from an existing design system / UI kit. That said, it is useful to understand how these widgets work so that you understand the basic idea.

Given this, please open the `05-carousel` folder and make the following changes:
1. Add comments to the `index.js` file explaining what each of the statements does.
2. **[Optional]** 
    * Stylize the buttons using one of the font-awesome icons (or some other image or icon).
    * Change out the photos.
    * Make any additional stylistic changes you see fit.

> **Understanding the Carousel**: The carousel works by moving all slides together using `transform: translateX()`. The math `(slideWidth + gap) * currentPosition` calculates how far to move based on the current position. For example, if each slide is 400px wide with a 10px gap, and we're at position 2, we move all slides by `(400 + 10) * 2 = 820px` to the left.

> For this task, you may not use an AI assistant to comment the `index.js` code for you. YOU need to do it.
