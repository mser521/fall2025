## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
* Structure a story-driven webpage using semantic HTML sections.
* Apply modern CSS layout and design techniques (sticky positioning, flex/grid, typography, color).
* Use a lightweight JavaScript library (or a few lines of vanilla JS) to trigger animations or visual changes on scroll.
* Think narratively about how data, text, and visuals unfold across a scrolling experience.
