num: "Final"

## Overview
For your final project, you will design an interactive or static data visualization project that tells an evidence-based story -- using both qualitative and quantitative data. The project should demonstrate mastery of visualization principles and communicate clearly to a public audience.
 

> ### Learning Goals
> * Practice analyzing and synthesizing data (numbers, stories, visuals).
> * Translate complex environmental information into accessible, engaging messages.
> * Consider the ethical, political, and cultural contexts of communicating science.
> * Produce materials that could live in the "real world" (e.g., a poster, website, social media thread, infographic, op-ed, short video).

## Project Components

### Issue Selection (with justification):
Choose an environmental issue that is socially or politically relevant (examples: wildfire risk communication, climate migration, flood preparedness, energy transition, air quality, biodiversity loss).

### Audience Analysis:

Identify a specific target audience (e.g., high school students, local policymakers, community members).

Discuss why this audience matters and what barriers they may face in understanding/acting.

### Data Gathering & Analysis:
* Quantitative: statistics, trends, models, climate projections, etc.
* Qualitative: interviews, stories, community voices, media framing.

Analyze how these types of data support and complicate each other.

### Communication Strategy
* What is the core message you want to convey?
* What tone, medium, and style are most effective for your audience?
* What best practices in science communication (from class) are you applying?

## Campaign Materials
Create at least two concrete outputs (e.g., infographic, 60-second video script, mock social media posts, op-ed draft, podcast outline, poster). These should be designed for your chosen audience and include both data and narrative.

## Reflection Paper (4–6 pages)

Explain your choices: issue, audience, data selection, framing strategies.

Critically evaluate challenges (e.g., contested science, uncertainty, politicization).

Reflect on what you learned about science communication through the project.

## Deliverables:

* Campaign materials (visuals/text/products).
* 4–6 page written reflection.
* Class presentations / gallery walk where students “pitch” their campaigns).



## Final Project: Designing a Science Communication Campaign

Overview
For your final project, you will design a science communication campaign about an environmental issue of your choice. This campaign should be designed for a specific audience and make use of both quantitative data (e.g., charts, maps, statistics) and qualitative data (e.g., interviews, stories, policy documents, media coverage). Your goal is to demonstrate how data can be used not just to inform, but to persuade and engage in a contested, real-world context.

## Project Requirements

### Topic Selection

* Choose an environmental issue that is socially or politically relevant (examples: wildfire risk communication, climate migration, flood preparedness, energy transition, air quality, biodiversity loss).
* Clearly articulate why this issue matters and who is affected.

### Audience & Goals (Proposal)
1. Identify a specific audience (e.g., local policymakers, high school students, rural residents, coastal homeowners, urban commuters, farmers).
1. State the communication goals of your campaign (e.g., raise awareness, influence behavior, build trust, correct misinformation).
1. Data Gathering & Analysis
    * Quantitative data: Use at least one dataset (could be from government sources, NGOs, or open repositories) and visualize it in a clear, compelling way.
    * Qualitative data: Draw on interviews, narratives, media analysis, or policy statements to provide context and highlight human perspectives.

### Campaign Materials
Create at least two deliverables that are appropriate for your audience. These might include:
* A social media infographic series
* A public service announcement (poster, video, or podcast script)
* A fact sheet or one-pager for policymakers
* An interactive visualization (e.g., Observable notebook, map, dashboard)
* A mock-up of a website or blog post series

### Written Report (6–8 pages)
In addition to your campaign materials, submit a report that includes:
* Background and significance of the issue
* Analysis of audience and communication challenges
* Explanation of your communication choices
* Reflection on the strengths and limitations of your approach

## Timeline
* Week X – Project proposal due (topic, audience, preliminary data sources)
* Week Y – Draft campaign materials due (for peer feedback)
* Week Z – Final project submission and presentations

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Relevance and clarity of issue framing
2. Depth and accuracy of data use (quant + qual)
3. Creativity and appropriateness of campaign materials for the chosen audience
4. Application of science communication best practices (audience-centered, transparent about uncertainty, mindful of controversy)
5. Quality of written report (organization, clarity, critical reflection)
