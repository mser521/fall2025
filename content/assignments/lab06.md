Practice looping over arrays and objects, applying conditionals, and preparing data for later visualization. Complete each exercise locally in your browser (open the `index.html` files) and use the console (`Cmd+Opt+J` in Chrome) to verify your work. Each exercise has a `main.js` with TODOs.

Links to starter files (open in the browser and your editor):

- 01 — Loop Basics: `/downloads/labs/lab06/01-loop-basics/`
- 02 — Aggregate Numbers: `/downloads/labs/lab06/02-aggregate-numbers/`
- 03 — Iterate Objects: `/downloads/labs/lab06/03-iterate-objects/`
- 04 — Transform Arrays: `/downloads/labs/lab06/04-transform-array/`
- 05 — Frequency Histogram: `/downloads/labs/lab06/05-frequency-histogram/`

Submission: Zip the `lab06` folder you worked in and upload to Moodle. Include comments in your `main.js` explaining any assumptions.
