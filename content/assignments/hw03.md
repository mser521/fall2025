In the first part of this assignment you found one example of a good visualization and one bad visualization. For this assignment you will improve the design of your bad visualization. You may use any tools available to you (e.g., photoshop, pen and paper, markers, Google Slides, HTML, Canva, etc.).

As part of your submission, you you should also describe how and why you redesigned the visualization....
