In the previous assignment, you identified one strong visualization and one weak visualization. Now you will focus on the weak example and practice redesigning it using Tableau.

## Your Task

1. Recreate (or download) the data from your “bad” visualization in a form you can import into Tableau (e.g., as a CSV or Excel file). You do not need to capture every data point exactly if the original source does not make it available—an approximate dataset is acceptable, as long as it reflects the message of the original.
1. Design two alternative visualizations in Tableau that attempt to present the same data more effectively. Each redesign should take a different approach (e.g., different chart types, different ways of grouping, filtering, or highlighting the data).
1. Publish your two visualizations to the Tableau Public Website.
1. Write a short reflection (<1 page, single spaced) that addresses:
    * What choices you made in each redesign (e.g., chart type, color, labels, scale).
    * What strengths or limitations each redesigned version has.
    * Which one you would recommend as the best way to present this data, and why.

## What to Submit

Please submit a document that includes the following:
* The original “bad” visualization with source citation.
* Links to your two redesigned Tableau visualizations.
* Your reflection (<1 page).

## Evaluation Criteria:
* Clear reproduction or approximation of the original dataset.
* Thoughtful design of two distinct visualization alternatives.
* Depth of comparative analysis (strengths, weaknesses, tradeoffs).
* Use of principles discussed in class (e.g., clarity, integrity, effective use of visual encodings).
