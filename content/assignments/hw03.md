The goal of this homework assignment is to build an interactive Tableau dashboard that communicates key insights from the **Global Flood Events** dataset. Your dashboard should highlight patterns across space, time, and severity, and invite viewers to reflect on the societal and environmental stakes.

## 1. Data Exploration / Cleaning
1. Open the flood events dataset in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PmAq8ZuaRKVMsfRE9rrTap8KXRv855dX/edit?gid=1605106824#gid=1605106824" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>. Then, make a copy of this file so that you can edit it.
2. Rename confusing fields so they’re clear.
3. Clean the data as needed (e.g., fix dates, fix spelling / capitalization mistakes, etc.).
4. Consider creating new columns, if necessary. Typically, you never want to delete the original columns, but you can make new ones to make your analysis easier. For instance:
    * You might want to create a "Continent" field to group contries into zones. 
    * You might also want to group certain types "Main Causes" into higher-level categories (like grouping all of the tropical storm events together into a new category called "Tropical Storm"). 
    * **Side note:** this is where AI could be really useful (i.e., "Add a new column that indicates which region of the world this country is in.")
5. When you're done, you will download your "cleaned" file as an XLSX file, and load it into Tableau.

## 2. Answer Core Questions with Visuals
Once your data is loaded into Tableau, you will begin creating your visualizations in preparation for your dashboard. Your dashboard should include **at least 3 distinct visualizations** (one from each category), addressing some of these questions (and feel free to select your own):

### 2.1. Trends Over Time
* How has the number of recorded flood events changed over time?
* Are there periods of increase/decrease that might connect to climate patterns (e.g., El Niño years)?

### 2.2. Geographic Patterns
* Which countries/regions experience the most floods?
* Where are the most severe floods (M>6) concentrated?

### 2.3. Severity & Magnitude
* What proportion of floods are severe (M>6) versus moderate (M>4)?
* How does this vary by continent or country?
* What seems to be the most distructive cause of flooding? Does this vary by year or is it pretty consistent? 


## 3. Design a Dashboard
Bring your visualizations together into a single interactive dashboard.

### 3.1. Required Elements
1. A map showing the spatial distribution of floods.
1. A time-series chart (line or area) showing trends in floods by year.
1. A bar or stacked bar chart showing severity (M>4 vs. M>6) by region or country.

### 3.2. Required Interactivity
1. At least one filter (e.g., by country, by year range, or by severity).
1. At least one highlight action (e.g., clicking a region filters other charts).

## 4. Critical Reflection
Add a paragraph to your dashboard, writing a short reflection addressing:

1. Who is the intended audience for your dashboard?
1. What story are you telling about floods?
1. What biases or data limitations should viewers keep in mind?

## What to turn in
1. Please paste a link to your public dashboard in the Moodle Assignment textbox. 
1. You will also share your dashboard with your classmates during class on the Thursday after Fall Break
