Over the past week, we've explored best practices in science communication, paying attention to the ways science can be contested and controversial for different reasons. In this homework assignment, you will critically synthesize those ideas and apply them to a real-world environmental policy scenario.

## Your Task
Select a public-facing science *or* environmental communication initiative - ideally one that addresses a controversial topic - and analyze how effective it is.

Your analysis (approx. 800–1,000 words) should include:

1. General Information
    * Describe the initiative (name, website url if applicable, organizer, medium, and target audience)?
    * What specific scientific or environmental issue does it address?

1. Communication Strengths
    * How does the campaign commuicate the science? (e.g., visuals, narratives, metaphors)
    * Does it connect to shared values or frame messages in terms that resonate with diverse audiences?
    * Are in-group messengers or framings used to increase trust?

1. Consideration of Political Sensitivities
    * If the topic is potentially politicized (e.g., climate adaptation, energy policy), how does the campaign navigate this?
    * Does it preempt skepticism or address mistrust? How?

1. Areas for Improvement
    * What could be improved—messaging, imagery, inclusivity, or trust building?
    * How might it do better with visualization, narrative, or stakeholder engagement?

In your analysis, integrate at least two readings or frameworks from course materials (e.g., Druckman et al. 2025; Lupia 2013; Tyson et al. 2023; Bolsen et al. 2018) to support your critique.

## Tips

### 1. Topics to consider
* Climate change (causes, severity, and solutions)
* Energy policy (renewables vs. fossil fuels, nuclear energy)
* COVID-19 and public health measures (mask mandates, vaccines)
* Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and food safety
* Evolution vs. creationism in education
* Stem cell research
* Environmental regulations (EPA rules, emissions standards)


### 2. Where to look
* Science communication websites (e.g., Nature, National Geographic, Scientific American, etc.)
* Government websites (e.g., CDC, NOAA, EPA, NIH, etc.)
* University / Research Websites (e.g., Yale Climate Connections, Inside Climate News, Carbon Brief, AAAS, etc.)
* General News outlets (e.g., NY Times, The Economist, The Atlantic, etc., PBS)
* Textbooks and educational materials for K-12

Feel free to search broadly. It doesn't have to be a website. Textbooks, kiosks, pamphlets, short videos, etc. are also OK.

## What to Submit
* Please submit a PDF to the Moodle by 11:59PM on the due date.
