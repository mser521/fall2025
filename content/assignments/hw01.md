Over the past week, we've explored best practices in science communication, paying attention to the ways science can be contested and controversial for different reasons. In this homework assignment, you will critically synthesize those ideas and apply them to a real-world environmental policy scenario.

## Your Task
Select a public-facing science *or* environmental communication campaign and analyze how effectively it communicates complex (and potentially contested) science-based information.

Your analysis (approx. 800–1,000 words) should include:

1. Campaign Overview
    * What is the campaign (name, organizer, medium, and target audience)?
    * What specific scientific or environmental issue does it address?

2. Communication Strengths
    * How does the campaign simplify complex science without oversimplifying? (e.g., visuals, narratives, metaphors)
    * Does it connect to shared values or frame messages in terms that resonate with diverse audiences?
    * Are in-group messengers or framings used to increase trust?

3. Consideration of Political Sensitivities
    * If the topic is potentially politicized (e.g., climate adaptation, energy policy), how does the campaign navigate this?
    * Does it preempt skepticism or address mistrust? How?

4. Areas for Improvement
    * What could be improved—messaging, imagery, inclusivity, or trust building?
    * How might it do better with visualization, narrative, or stakeholder engagement?

In your analysis, cite at least two readings or frameworks from course materials (e.g., Druckman et al. 2025; Lupia 2013; Tyson et al. 2023; Bolsen et al. 2018) to support your critique.
