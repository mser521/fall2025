This lab is designed to help you:
1. Design a data protocol (i.e., choosing measurements and indicators, considering data types, and thinking about sampling strategies)
1. Practice cleaning and organizing messy data  
1. Ask and answer questions with data (at a high level)

You will work on this lab in small groups (3–4 people). Each group will select a different theme, and then answer the questions on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zcj3GWpwqrgaZudeN7uJ-Qa5NY6uMPSDvDEXJZxKuIE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this worksheet</a>. Themes:

* **Group 1:** Vaccination access
* **Group 2:** Air quality
* **Group 3:** Understanding traffic stop procedures (policing) 

Although you’ll be collaborating as a group and discussing answers to the questions together, each member should write their responses to the questions individually and submit their own worksheet.
