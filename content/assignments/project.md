title: "Design a Data-Intensive Science Communication Campaign"
date: "2025-08-26"
type: "final project"
draft: 0
---

For your final project, you will design a data communication campaign that tells a story using both quantitative (e.g., charts, maps, statistics) and qualitative (e.g., interviews, stories, documents, media coverage) data.

Your campaign should be designed for a specific audience and should take a clear point of view - not just informing, but persuading, engaging, or surprising. While many students may choose an environmental or resilience-related issue, you are also welcome to explore more cultural, whimsical, or curiosity-driven topics (e.g., the rise of LEGO Star Wars sets, changes in pop lyrics, or the growth of board game culture).

The core goal is the same: to show how data, combined with storytelling, can move people - whether to care about an urgent challenge or to see something familiar in a new light.

## Project Overview

### 1. Topic Selection

Choose a topic that lends itself to storytelling with data. This might be:
* Environmental & resilience issues (wildfire risk, climate migration, flood preparedness, energy transition, air quality, biodiversity loss).
* Cultural or lifestyle topics (music trends, LEGO evolution, board games, movies, sports, food culture).

Regardless of the dataset you choose, clearly articulate why this topic matters (to you, your audience, or society) and what perspective or insight you want to highlight.

### 2. Audience & Goals (Proposal)
1. Identify a specific audience (e.g., local policymakers, high school students, fans of LEGO, trivia enthusiasts, climate activists).
1. State the communication goals of your campaign (e.g., raise awareness, inspire curiosity, influence behavior, correct misconceptions, highlight hidden patterns).

### 3. Data Sources
1. **Quantitative data**: Use at least one dataset (from government sources, NGOs, cultural databases, APIs, or open repositories) and visualize it in a clear, compelling way.
1. **Qualitative data**: Add depth by drawing on interviews, narratives, media coverage, policy documents, or other sources that highlight human or cultural context.

Document your data sources and choices clearly.

### 4. Analysis & Visualization

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends, patterns, and surprises. When you're done, create at least 3 visualizations, including:

1. One chart (bar, line, scatter, histogram, etc.)
1. One visualization that goes beyond a “default” chart (e.g., map, network diagram, custom graphic, annotated chart).
1. One element that integrates qualitative content (e.g., photo with data overlay, timeline annotated with quotes).

Use appropriate labels, scales, and colors - accuracy + clarity come first.

### 5. Campaign Materials
Create at least two deliverables that are appropriate for your audience: 
1. Your first deliverable **must be a website** with photos, embedded charts, and a clear narrative that helps your audience navigate the visualization.
1. Your second deliverable can be anything you want:
    * A social media infographic
    * A public service announcement (poster, video, or podcast script)
    * A fact sheet or one-pager for policymakers
    * A video
    * A zine

Ensure that both deliverables communicate your idea effectively using data.

### 6. Design & Aesthetics
* The project should be visually polished (consistent fonts, colors, layout).
* Use annotations and narrative text to guide the viewer.
* Strive for professional design quality: this should look like something you’d proudly show in a symposium.

### 7. Iteration & Feedback
* Share an early draft with peers (Week 12).
* Gather feedback on clarity, design, and storytelling.
* Submit a revised final version that responds thoughtfully to feedback.

### 8. Write-Up
Include a short write-up (2-3 pages or equivalent) that:
* Introduces your question and motivation.
* Describes your dataset(s).
* Explains your design choices and iteration process.
* Reflects on what you learned about your topic and about data communication.

### 9. Presentation
* Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation.
* Summarize your project’s story, audience, and visualizations.
* Practice: make sure your visuals are legible and your narrative is focused.

## Logistics

### 1. Timeline of Deliverables
* **Week 10 (Oct. 21)** - Project proposal due (topic, audience, preliminary data sources)
* **Week 13 (Nov. 11)** - Draft campaign materials due (for peer feedback)
* **Week 16 (Dec. 2)** - Final round of user testing (for peer feedback)
* **Week 17** - Final project submission and presentations

### 2. Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be assessed on:
1. **Minimum Requirements Met** - Qualitative and quantitative datasets, required visualizations included, 2 deliverables, etc.
1. **Clarity & Storytelling** - Is the message clear and engaging for the chosen audience?
1. **Data Use** - Are both quantitative and qualitative data integrated effectively?
1. **Visual Design** - Are visualizations accurate, polished, and aesthetically strong?
1. **Iteration & Reflection** - Did you test, revise, and reflect thoughtfully?
1. **Presentation** - Was your talk clear, confident, and visually effective?

## Potential Project Ideas / Datasets
I encourage you to pursue your own questions, but here are some ideas to get you started:
