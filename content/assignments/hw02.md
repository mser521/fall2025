Information visualizations are everywhere (e.g., in government websites, news outlets, and social media feeds). Each visualization is created with a point of view in mind, highlighting certain aspects of the data while downplaying others.

For this assignment, your task is to find **one strong (effective) visualization** and **one weak (ineffective) visualization** from an authoritative online or print source.

Once you have selected your examples, you will:

1. Take a screenshot of each visualization and provide the source and link (if applicable).
2. Explain what each visualization is attempting to communicate.
3. Evaluate why the visualization is effective (for the good one) or ineffective (for the bad one), drawing on the principles and readings we’ve discussed in class. 

Aim for a 1/2 page (single spaced) of description and analysis for each visualization.

**Note**: In Homework 3, you will be redesigning your chosen “bad” visualization to improve it—so select examples you will want to work with again.

## What to Submit
Please submit a PDF document with the visualization screenshots, sources, descriptions, and analysis. Be prepared to discuss your analyses in class.
