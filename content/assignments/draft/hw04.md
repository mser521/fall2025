## Overview

This assignment bridges the narrative visualization concepts we've discussed with your final project. You will create a **storyboard and annotated mockup** for your final project website, focusing on how you'll guide viewers through your data story.

## Your Task

Create a narrative visualization plan for your final project that includes:

### 1. Story Structure (1 page)

Choose a narrative structure for your project (martini glass, slideshow, scrollytelling, annotated chart, or drill-down). Then answer:

- **What is your one key message?** (1-2 sentences)
- **What narrative structure will you use?** Why is this structure appropriate for your story and audience?
- **How will you hook viewers?** What will they see/read first?
- **How will information unfold?** Describe the progression (beginning → middle → end)

### 2. Storyboard (2-3 pages)

Create a storyboard showing the key "scenes" or sections of your website. For each scene, include:

- **Visual sketch** (can be hand-drawn or digital) showing layout
- **Text content** (headlines, subheadings, key body text)
- **Data visualization** (what chart/map/graphic will appear)
- **Annotations** (what labels, callouts, or highlights will guide interpretation)
- **Interactions** (if any: hover states, filters, scroll triggers, etc.)

**Minimum**: Your storyboard should show at least 4-5 key scenes/sections.

### 3. Annotated Mockup (1-2 pages)

Create one detailed mockup of your most important visualization. This should show:

- The actual chart/map/graphic (can be a rough sketch or created in Tableau/other tool)
- **Annotations**: Labels, callouts, highlights that guide interpretation
- **Text integration**: Headlines, captions, body text that provide context
- **Visual hierarchy**: Notes about color, size, position choices

### 4. Reflection (1 page)

Reflect on your design choices:

- How does your narrative structure support your communication goals?
- What techniques are you using to guide viewers' attention?
- How are you balancing narrative guidance with allowing exploration?
- What challenges do you anticipate in implementing this design?

## Format

You can submit this as:
- A PDF document with sketches, text, and reflections
- A Google Slides presentation
- A Figma/Canva mockup with annotations
- A combination of the above

**The goal is clarity, not artistic perfection.** Hand-drawn sketches are perfectly fine!

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be assessed on:

1. **Clarity of Message**: Is your key message clear and focused?
2. **Appropriate Structure**: Is your chosen narrative structure well-suited to your story and audience?
3. **Narrative Techniques**: Are you using annotations, visual hierarchy, and text integration effectively?
4. **Completeness**: Does your storyboard show a complete narrative arc?
5. **Reflection**: Do you demonstrate thoughtful consideration of design choices?

## Tips

- **Start simple**: You don't need to use every technique. Focus on what serves your story.
- **Think about your audience**: What do they already know? What context do they need?
- **Test your story**: Try explaining your narrative structure to a friend. Is it clear?
- **Consider implementation**: Think about what's feasible with your current technical skills (HTML/CSS/JS, Tableau embeds, etc.)

## What to Submit

Please submit a PDF or link to your storyboard, mockup, and reflection by 11:59PM on the due date.
