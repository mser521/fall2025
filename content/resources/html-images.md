The job of an image tag is to embed an image inside of a web page. This is distinct from a hyperlink (`a` tag), whose job it is to jump to a new resource.

## Example

<iframe src="//codepen.io/vanwars/embed/YaWqaM/?theme-id=18654&default-tab=html,result" allowfullscreen="true" class="codepen-frame"></iframe>
