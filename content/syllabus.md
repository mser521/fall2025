## Course Description

This course applies principles from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and information visualization to the design of interactive data tools and systems. Through hands-on projects, case studies, and research papers, students will explore the effectiveness of data systems in environmental planning from multiple perspectives. Students will learn how to select between different visual displays of information; assess the usability and effectiveness of data interfaces; communicate data insights through clear, compelling narratives; and understand the possibilities and challenges of using interactive data tools to inform public planning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Apply principles of effective visual design and perception to data communication.
- Analyze and critique data sources and underlying assumptions.
- Use common tools (e.g., Excel, Tableau, Python, R, JavaScript) to visualize and analyze data.
- Craft data stories tailored to different audiences, including policymakers and the public.
- Analyze on ethical and social issues related to data representation.
