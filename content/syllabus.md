## Course Description

This course applies principles from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and information visualization to the design of interactive data tools and systems. Through hands-on projects, case studies, and research papers, students will explore the effectiveness of data systems in environmental planning from multiple perspectives. Students will learn how to select between different visual displays of information; assess the usability and effectiveness of data interfaces; communicate data insights through clear, compelling narratives; and understand the possibilities and challenges of using interactive data tools to inform public planning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Analyze, interpret, and communicate with data effectively to different stakeholders / audiences

## University Policies & Resources

### Office of Accessibility & Academic Accommodations
UNC Asheville is committed to providing accessible learning environments and equal opportunity to individuals with disabilities in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> and <a href="https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/section-504" target="_blank">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</a>.

If you are a student experiencing barriers to access or full participation in this course on the basis of a disability, contact the Office of Accessibility (OA) to apply for reasonable accommodations and discuss available resources. You may contact the OA at academicaccess@unca.edu or 828-251-6292 or visit Zageir Hall Room 120.

To discuss approved academic accommodations, please contact me as early in the semester as possible and provide your letter of accommodation (LOA) from the <a href="https://new.unca.edu/iia/accessibility/" target="_blank">OA</a>. I want to ensure that we have adequate time and a confidential setting to discuss and arrange your approved accommodations. Accommodations are not retroactive and will be implemented when the LOA is discussed. 


### Promoting Gender Equity, Responding to Sexual Misconduct
UNC Asheville is dedicated to cultivating and maintaining a safe, respectful, and supportive environment, free from harassment and discrimination. We strive to ensure that all have equal access to the educational and employment opportunities the University provides. If you or someone you know has been affected by sex-based harassment or sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please know that help and support are available. UNC Asheville strongly encourages all members of the community to take action, seek support, and report incidents of sexual harassment to the Office for Institutional Integrity & Access (OIIA). You may contact the OIIA or Heather Lindkvist, Assistant Vice Chancellor and Title IX Coordinator, directly at 828.232.5658 or via titleix@unca.edu or learn more by visiting the <a href="https://new.unca.edu/iia/title-ix/" target="_blank">Title IX website</a>.

As a faculty member, I am a “responsible employee” and private resource. This means that if you share any information or discuss an incident with me regarding sexual or gender-based harassment, I must disclose this information to the Title IX Coordinator. Our goal is to ensure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you may need. 

If you wish to speak with a confidential resource, contact <a href="https://new.unca.edu/hcc/" target="_blank">University Health and Counseling Services</a> at 828.251.6520. Off-campus confidential resources include <a href="https://www.ourvoicenc.org/" target="_blank">Our Voice</a> (24-Hour Hotline at 828.255.7576) and <a href="https://helpmateonline.org/" target="_blank">Helpmate</a> (24-Hour Hotline at 828.254.0516).


### Protection from Harassment and Discrimination
Maintaining  welcoming, respectful, and equitable living, learning, and working environments is a shared responsibility at UNC Asheville. All community members are expected to engage respectfully, foster free expression, recognize diverse viewpoints, and protect against harm. Discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and retaliation are prohibited in all educational programs and employment opportunities.
 
The Office for Institutional Integrity and Access (OIIA) advances these efforts and provides support to any community member who seeks assistance regarding unlawful discrimination, barriers to access, or unwelcome conduct. Individuals may contact the OIIA to report an allegation of discrimination or discriminatory harassment based on their actual or perceived status, including age, race, color, national origin, religion (including belief or non-belief), disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy or related conditions, veteran status, genetic information, or other legally protected status.
 
For guidance or to report concerns, contact Heather Lindkvist, Assistant Vice Chancellor, directly at 828.232.5658 or at hlindkvi@unca.edu or in Highsmith 116. Learn more by visiting the <a href="https://new.unca.edu/iia/" target="_blank">OIIA website</a>.

### Religious Accommodations
UNC Asheville accords students, on an individual basis, the opportunity to observe their traditional religious holy days. Students desiring to observe a religious holy day of special importance must notify me directly (suggested time frames: two weeks of the start of the semester or at least seven business days in advance of the scheduled observance). The request should be made in writing and should state (1) the specific accommodation being requested, (2) the religious practice or belief the student holds, (3) how the requested accommodation enables the student to participate in their religious practice or belief, and (4) the date(s) and/or frequency of the requested accommodation. We will then meet to discuss what reasonable accommodation will be implemented, such as options for missed discussions, exams, or other assignments. You are entitled to make up assignments without penalty due to an excused absence for a religious observance. Students may request a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances. The Office for Institutional Integrity & Access is available as a resource if students or faculty have questions about this process.

### Academic Alerts
Faculty at UNC Asheville have access to an Academic Alert system. The purpose of this system is to support communication with students about their progress in courses, especially if there are concerns (e.g., academic difficulty, attendance problems). Professors use the Alert system because they are invested in their students’ success. Entering an academic alert is a great way to supplement open conversations between instructors and students about how students can improve their academic performance. 

Alerts should not replace your direct outreach to and communication with the student. They are intended to serve as a way to document your concern and outreach and/or activate the larger support system for the student as needed. Hence, an alert should only be entered after the instructor has reached out to the student directly.

When a faculty member submits an alert that expresses a concern, the student receives outreach from their academic advisor or the team in the Office of Academic Advising. Students are no longer receiving automated notification emails when an alert is submitted. It is in the student's best interest to address the alert quickly, as students who do so are more likely to earn credit for the course. Questions about the Academic Alert system can be directed to Anne Marie Roberts (amrober1@unca.edu) in the <a href="https://www.unca.edu/academics/academic-success/" target="_blank">Academic Success Center</a>.

### Academic Honesty
The university’s policy on academic honesty states that “As a community of scholars dedicated to learning and the pursuit of knowledge UNC Asheville relies on the honesty and academic integrity of all the members of its community. Any act of plagiarism or cheating is academic dishonesty. A person who knowingly assists another in cheating is likewise guilty of cheating. According to the instructor’s view of the gravity of the offense, a student may be punished by a failing grade or a grade of zero for the assignment or test, or a failing grade in the course. If it seems warranted, the instructor may also recommend to the Provost dismissal or other serious university sanction.” I expect that you will exercise integrity in all quizzes, exams, and written assignments. Please email me or pop in during student hours if you have additional questions or need clarification on any point.
