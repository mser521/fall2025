## Course Description

This course applies principles from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and information visualization to the design of interactive data tools and systems. Through hands-on projects, case studies, and research papers, students will explore the effectiveness of data systems in environmental planning from multiple perspectives. Students will learn how to select between different visual displays of information; assess the usability and effectiveness of data interfaces; communicate data insights through clear, compelling narratives; and understand the possibilities and challenges of using interactive data tools to inform public planning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Analyze, interpret, and communicate with data effectively to different stakeholders / audiences
- Analyze and critique data sources and underlying assumptions
- Apply principles of effective visual design and perception to data communication
- Apply UX/UI principles to evaluate, test, and refine based on user feedback
- Develop technical fluency with data analysis and visualization tools
- Understand both the possibilities and limits of using data to represent complex problems
