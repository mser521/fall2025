Open <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kR9VPs0In0o8Z-Dc_xt55Qp2QjSyE5N7SiL2ykROhk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this coffee data spreadsheet</a> in Google sheets. Then make a copy of it (so you can edit it). Pretend this spreadsheet represents all coffee sales for Texas, California, and Florida in 2024.

> ## Spreadsheet Basics
> 1. Sorting
> 2. Filtering
> 3. Aggregating (pivot tables)
> 
> ### Pivot Table Tips
> To make a pivot table, Insert > Pivot Table (select "New Sheet")
> Three different options: *values*, *rows*, and *columns*:
> 1. **Values:** What you want to measure or add up (e.g., Total Cups Sold, Average Sales)
> 2. **Rows:** What you want to list or group by (e.g., States, Months, Coffee Types)
> 3. **Columns:** How you want to break those groups apart (e.g., Months across the top, Coffee Types across the top)
