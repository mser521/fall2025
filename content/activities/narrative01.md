## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Identify different narrative visualization structures
- Analyze how text, annotations, and interactions guide viewers
- Evaluate the effectiveness of narrative techniques
- Apply these insights to your own project planning

## Part 1: Individual Analysis (15 minutes)

Choose **one** of the following narrative visualizations to analyze:

### Option A: Scrollytelling
<a href="https://pudding.cool/2025/06/hello-stranger/" target="_blank">The Pudding - Hello Stranger</a>
- How does the story unfold as you scroll?
- What visual techniques guide your attention?
- How is text integrated with the visualizations?

### Option B: Scrollytelling with Visual Metaphor
<a href="https://eattherichtextformat.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/" target="_blank">1 Pixel Wealth</a>
- How does scrolling reveal scale and build understanding?
- What visual metaphor is used (pixels = wealth)?
- How does the physical act of scrolling reinforce the message?
- How are comparisons and context integrated into the narrative?

### Option C: Annotated Timeline
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/EVOLUTION/yxmpjqkdzvr/" target="_blank">Reuters - How the novel coronavirus has evolved</a>
- How do annotations guide interpretation?
- What visual hierarchy techniques are used?
- How does the timeline structure support the story?

### Option D: Martini Glass Structure
<a href="https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/" target="_blank">Gapminder - Dollar Street</a>
- What is the initial focused message (the "stem")?
- How does the interactive exploration (the "glass") work?
- Does it return to a main message at the end?

**For your chosen visualization, answer these questions:**

1. **Story Structure**: What narrative structure does it use? (Martini glass, slideshow, scrollytelling, annotated chart, drill-down)

2. **Opening/Hook**: How does it grab your attention? What is the initial message?

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: How does information unfold? What do you see first, second, third?

4. **Annotations**: What text, labels, or callouts guide your interpretation? Give 2-3 specific examples.

5. **Visual Hierarchy**: What visual techniques (color, size, position, contrast) emphasize key points?

6. **Integration**: How well do text and visuals work together? Are they connected or separate?

7. **Effectiveness**: What works well? What could be improved?

## Part 2: Small Group Discussion (20 minutes)

In groups of 3-4:

1. **Share** your analysis with your group (5 minutes per person)
2. **Compare** the different narrative structures you analyzed
3. **Discuss**: 
   - Which techniques seem most effective for different types of stories?
   - What common patterns do you notice across the examples?
   - How might you apply these techniques to your final project?

## Part 3: Whole Class Discussion (15 minutes)

As a class, we'll discuss:

1. What makes a visualization "narrative" vs. "exploratory"?
2. When should you use a narrative approach vs. letting users explore freely?
3. How do narrative techniques relate to the communication principles we've discussed (attention, trust, framing)?
4. What ethical considerations are important when telling stories with data?

## Reflection (5 minutes)

Write down 2-3 specific techniques you want to try in your final project. Be specific:
- "I want to use annotations to highlight the three key data points in my chart"
- "I'll structure my website as a scrollytelling experience with sections that reveal as you scroll"
- "I'll use a martini glass structure: start with one key finding, then allow exploration"
