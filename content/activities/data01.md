Activity:
1. The authors argue that the phrase "raw data" is self-contradictory. What assumptions do we bring when we describe data as “raw”? How does reframing data as “cooked” or constructed challenge these assumptions?

2. According to Gitelman and Jackson, data must be “imagined as data to exist.” Choose a familiar dataset (e.g., census data, weather records) — how was it “imagined” into being? What decisions shaped its existence?

3. The authors note that terms like “collected,” “mined,” or “processed” all imply the act of interpretation. Can you trace an example from your own experience in which interpretation influenced how data were handled or understood?

4. Gitelman and Jackson frame data as abstract, aggregative, and graphically mobilized. Discuss what each of those terms might mean, and how they manifest in different fields (e.g., science, humanities, journalism).

5. The introduction suggests that each discipline has its own way of “imagining data.” How might historians, economists, scientists, and artists differ in how they conceptualize and use data?

6. The essay warns of a growing faith in data’s neutrality and objectivity. Why might this faith be appealing? What dangers or blind spots might it create in public discourse or scientific practice?
