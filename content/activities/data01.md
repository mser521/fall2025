## Potential Discussion Questions
1. The authors argue that the phrase "raw data" is self-contradictory. What assumptions do we bring when we describe data as “raw”? How does reframing data as “cooked” or constructed challenge these assumptions?

2. According to Gitelman and Jackson, data must be “imagined as data to exist.” Choose a familiar dataset (e.g., census data, weather records) — how was it “imagined” into being? What decisions shaped its existence?

3. The authors note that terms like “collected,” “mined,” or “processed” all imply the act of interpretation. Can you trace an example from your own experience in which interpretation influenced how data were handled or understood?

4. Gitelman and Jackson frame data as abstract, aggregative, and graphically mobilized. Discuss what each of those terms might mean, and how they manifest in different fields (e.g., science, humanities, journalism).

5. The introduction suggests that each discipline has its own way of “imagining data.” How might historians, economists, scientists, and artists differ in how they conceptualize and use data?

6. The essay warns of a growing faith in data’s neutrality and objectivity. Why might this faith be appealing? What dangers or blind spots might it create in public discourse or scientific practice?


## Potential Activity: How is Data Imagined into Being?

> **Goal**: Explore how datasets are constructed, interpreted, and maintained, revealing that data are never “raw” but always shaped by human choices.

### 1. Pick a Dataset

### 2. Answer the Questions
According to Gitelman & Jackson, “data must be imagined as data to exist.” Apply this to your dataset:

1. **Origins and Imagination:** Who decided this dataset should exist? What was the original purpose? What assumptions were made about what counts as “data” here?

1. **Decisions and Design:** What was included or excluded from the dataset? How were categories defined (e.g., race, gender, location)? What measurement standards or units were chosen?

1. **Context and Interpretation:** Who uses this data and for what purposes? How does the context of collection shape its meaning? Are there limitations or biases built in?

1. **Maintenance and Longevity:**  How is this dataset kept up-to-date or preserved over time? What work is required to make it usable (cleaning, storage, metadata)?

1. **Ethical and Social Dimensions:** Whose voices or perspectives are missing? What social or political consequences might follow from how this data is imagined and structured?

### 3. Visualization
Draw a quick diagram or concept map showing the human choices and processes involved in creating and maintaining your dataset.

### 4. Share Out
Prepare a 3-minute summary for the class:
* One surprising decision you discovered.
* One implication for how we interpret this data.
