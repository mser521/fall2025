Activity:

1. Compare two sources reporting the same environmental variable (e.g., global COâ‚‚ concentration from Mauna Loa vs. satellite-derived estimates).
1. Discuss: trust-building mechanisms (peer review, replication, calibration) and what erodes public trust (political narratives, data cherry-picking).
