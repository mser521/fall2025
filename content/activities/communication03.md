## Learning Goals

1. Recognize how political identity of a messenger shapes perception of environmental issues.
1. Distinguish between in-group and out-group elite cues.
1. Reflect on how this influences public trust in data, science, and policy.

## Terms

* **Elite cue**: A signal about how to think about an issue coming from a political or ideological leader.
* **In-group cue**: From a leader aligned with the audience’s identity.
* **Out-group cue**: From a leader on the opposite side of the political or ideological spectrum.

Research shows people often respond more to who says it than what is said.

## In small groups

Consider the following headlines:

> * President Joe Biden Calls for 100% Clean Electricity by 2035
> * NOAA Report Shows 2023 Was the Hottest Year on Record
> * Governor Ron DeSantis Signs Law Limiting Offshore Wind Development in Florida
> * Study Finds Wetland Restoration Improves Flood Protection and Biodiversity
> * Senator Elizabeth Warren Proposes $50 Billion Plan for Renewable Energy Research
> * U.S. Geological Survey Releases Data on Declining Groundwater Levels in Midwest
> * House GOP Leaders Introduce Bill to Ease Regulations on Oil and Gas Drilling
> * Vice President Kamala Harris Urges Nationwide Ban on Gas-Powered Vehicles by 2035
> * New Satellite Data Reveals Rapid Ice Loss in Antarctic Glaciers
> * Senator Ted Cruz Backs Pipeline Expansion to Boost U.S. Energy Independence
> * Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Pushes for $15 Billion Urban Tree Canopy Initiative
> * Representative Kevin McCarthy Criticizes Federal Carbon Tax Proposal as “Job Killer”

In groups of 2-3: 
1. Identify who the likely in-group and out-group audiences are for each headline.
1. Discuss whether the cue could influence perception of the data itself (not just the policy).

## Whole-Class Discussion

1. Did you notice patterns in which cues triggered stronger reactions?
1. Could the same statement be an in-group cue for one audience and out-group for another?
1. How might elite cues influence trust in environmental data?
1. How can communicators reduce the polarizing effect of out-group cues?
