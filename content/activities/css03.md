## 1. Practice Using Background Images<span id="bi"></span>

See if you can create an interesting scene that uses background images:

<img class="screenshot-xl border-1" src="/fall2025/images/activities/css-flourishes/background-images.gif" alt="image of the animation" />

### 1.1. Uncomment the relevant CSS properties
Open `in-class-exercise` and take a look at the HTML and CSS files to get oriented with them. Then, before making any changes to the code, preview the `index.html` page in your web browser.
    
After previewing your webpage, **uncomment** the following lines inside your `styles.css` file within your `header` style block. 

```css
  /* background-image: url('solar-eclipse.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position-x: center;
    background-position-y: center; */
```

When you're done, preview the page, noting what changed. You should now see a background image in your `header` of a solar eclipse.

Next, uncomment the following lines within your `#section2` style block:

```css
/* background-image: url('solar-eclipse-multiples.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: center right;
background-size: contain;
background-attachment: fixed; */
```

When you're done, preview the page. You should now see a background image of a series of photos of an eclipse behind a box of white text. The image should be anchored as you scroll. 
* Note that if you remove the `background-attachment: fixed;` declaration, the background image will move with the scroll bar (no anchoring). Try it!

### 1.2. Add Custom Images
Customize this page with your own background images.

* If you're looking for free images, check out: 
    * <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">pexels.com</a>
    * <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">unsplash.com</a>

* When you've found some images that you like, save them inside of the `in-class-exercise` folder, and update the background-image file paths to point to your files. 
* If you want to explore some of the other background properties, take a look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a>


### 1.3. Try Out the Filters
If you have time, also try playing with some of the background filters. Here is a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_filter.asp" target="_blank">list of available filters</a> (also on W3 Schools).  The options for the filter property are:

* none
* blur()
* brightness()
* contrast()
* drop-shadow()
* grayscale()
* hue-rotate()
* invert()
* opacity()
* saturate()
* sepia()
* url()


**Hint**: try adding `filter: invert(180);` to the `header` style block in your CSS file to see what happens.


### 1.4. Try adding a video background
* Take a look at the video background sample files and see if you can add a section somewhere on the page that has a video background. Refer to the<br> `css-flourishes-demos/05-video-background` folder to see if you can figure out how to do it.
* <a href="https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/background%20videos/" target="_blank">pexels.com</a> has some free video backgrounds that you can download.





## 2. Experimenting with Transitions<span id="t"></span>
See if you can explore some interesting transitions:

<img class="screenshot-xl border-1" src="/fall2025/images/activities/css-flourishes/transitions.gif" alt="image of the animation" />

### 2.1. Uncomment the relevant CSS style blocks
Inside of the `in-class-exercise` folder, take a look at the HTML and CSS files to get oriented with them. Then, before making any changes to the code, preview the `index.html` page in your web browser.

After previewing your webpage, **uncomment** the following lines inside your `styles.css` style block:

```css
/*
#section1 {
    background: #0c7474;
    color: white;
    transition: all 0.3s ease-out;
}

#section1:hover {
    background: purple;
    width: 220px;
    height: 220px;
}
*/
```

When you're done, preview the page, noting what changed. When you hover over the first section, you the section should grow and change color (horray)! 

### 2.2. Create two more transition effects

Your job is to experiment with the other two section tags (`#section2` and `#section3`) by making some interesting interactions, using transitions. Some tips:

1. To make a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp" target="_blank">transition</a>, you define a transition inside of a style block (e.g., `#section1`) as follows: `transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;` 
  Examples:
      * transition: all 0.3s ease-out;
      * transition: background 1s ease-in;
      * transition: all 3s linear;
      * transition: all 0.3s ease;

2. Some properties that you may want to change:
    * border-radius
    * margin
    * padding
    * width
    * height
    * border-width
    * background-color
    * rotation
    * opacity
    * <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp" target="_blank">transform</a>. Examples<br>transform: skewX(20deg);<br>transform: rotate(-10deg);
    {:.compact}

Feel free to look at `sample-files/01-pseudo-classes` and `sample-files/02-pseudo-classes-with-transitions` to get ideas.

### 2.3. Implement one of the CSS Tricks Effects

When you're done with parts 1-2, please try experimenting with hyperlink hover effects. Recall that hyperlinks have several relevant states that you want to style:

* a
* a:link
* a:hover (the main interactive state)
* a:focus (if the person tabs to the link)
* a:visited (if you want the style of visited links to look different)
* a:active (if you want a different style when the person clicks the link)

Click on some of the "CSS Tricks" links above, and see if you can implement one of the techniques that you find interesting.



## 3. Keyframes Exercise: Build a Landscape<span id="k"></span>

See if you can create a landscape animation:

<img class="screenshot-xl border-1" src="/fall2025/images/activities/css-flourishes/landscape-animation.gif" alt="image of the animation" />


### 3.1. Uncomment the relevant CSS style blocks
Inside of the `your-task` downloads folder, open `03-keyframes`, and take a look at the HTML and CSS files to get oriented with them. Then, before making any changes to the code, preview the index.html page in your web browser. You should see one cloud moving from left to right.

After previewing your webpage, **uncomment** the following two code blocks inside your `styles.css`:

Inside of #sun:
```css
/* animation-timing-function: linear;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards; 
    animation-name: sunrise;
    animation-delay: 1s;
    animation-duration: 12s; */
```

Also comment out the corresponding keyframe that controls the sunrise:
```css
/* @keyframes sunrise {
    0% { 
        transform: translate(0, 0);
    }
    100% { 
        transform: translate(0, -70vh); 
    }
} */
```

When youâ€™re done, preview the page, noting what changed. You should now see a second cloud moving from right to left.

### 3.2. Play around with the existing animation

1. Try experimenting with the `animation-delay`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function` (ease-in, ease-out, ease, etc.) to change the speed and timing of the animation.
2. See if you can make the sun change from orange to yellow as it rises. 
3. See if you can make the size of the sun change as it rises.
    * Hint: Add some additional style rules to the `to {}` block of the `sunrise` keyframe.

### 3.3. Make one of the clouds move
See if you can make `#cloud1` animate from left to right. To do this, **uncomment** the following two code blocks inside your `styles.css`:

Within the `#cloud1` selector:

```css
/* transform: translate(-30vw, 0); */

/* animation-timing-function: linear;
animation-iteration-count: infinite; 
animation-direction: alternate;
animation-name: moveCloudHorizontally;
animation-delay: 1s;
animation-duration: 18s; */
```

Also comment out the corresponding keyframe that controls the cloud movement:

```css
/* @keyframes moveCloudHorizontally {
    0% { 
        transform: translate(-30vw, 0);
    }
    100% { 
        transform: translate(110vw, 0); 
    }
} */
```

See what happens.


### 3.4. Add more clouds
See if you can add more clouds that move in different directions and at different speeds.
